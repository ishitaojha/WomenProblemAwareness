      Period unawareness refers to the lack of knowledge and inadequate access to menstrual hygiene products like pads and tampons every month.The normal Period is not a definite parameter for all women, it is different for different women. A woman needs to observe how her menstrual cycle works, her flow and duration and based on this each woman should be able to identify inconsistency in her period.

      Some students may miss school because of painful period cramps or inability to deal with side effects such as headaches or stomach aches. Women make up 13% of America's local jail population, which oftentimes overshadows their need for adequate menstrual products.While you may not have the energy or mental motivation for a full-on workout, increasing your heart rate releases endorphins, feel-good chemicals that improve your mood and also help you relax.

Boosting your circulation will also increase bloodflow to your pelvic region, which in turn helps alleviate cramps. Practicing certain gentle yoga poses can soothe and relieve period-related pain and tension

    <p>
      Menstruating is a natural body process.
      The products are a necessity, not a luxury, and should be treated as such. Yet, currently, 30 states view these items as luxury goods and impose sales tax on them. If medication and groceries are considered necessities and are tax-free in most states, then period products should be too. This tax not only invalidates the needs of women but also adds more economic stress to low-income menstruators. The tampon tax should be abolished in every state.

        What about Menstruation rights?
      </h2>
<div id="demobox" style="background-color:#570406; padding: 10px; border: 8px solid #Dd3d41;">

      <p>
        Whenever menstruation rights are brought into the discussion, transgender and non-binary people who menstruate are often forgotten or left out. Anyone who menstruates should be included when talking about their own health. We can break the stigma by creating safe spaces to make it easier to talk to others about periods so that others don't feel ashamed or told that menstruation is gross and should not be talked about. Another good option is teaching menstruation health in classes to both genders so this conversation can be pushed further. Change cannot happen if we ignore the problem, so we must talk about this more.

<h1 class= "top">What Are Periods?</h1>
<p>
  Periods generally occur every 28 days and lasts 5-7 days. During this period, a menstruator discards about 2-4 tablespoons of blood and tissue from the lining of the uterus. Most experiences headaches, back pain, cramps, muscle aches, joint pain, and an increase in the hormone progesterone. On average, a menstruator has period for 38 years, 456 cycles, 2,281 days of menstruating, and pays an average of $11,000 on period products, and use almost 17,000 pads or tampons in their lifetime to keep blood from staining clothing/surfaces. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<div id="demobox" style="background-color:#570406; padding: 10px; border: 8px solid pink;">
<br>


<h1>Periods Have No Gender</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Periods don't happen only in females. It can occur in people of all genders. Many people don't use gender-neutral languages like "menstruators" when discussing periods, but we have changed from saying "fireman" to "firefighter." Using gender-neutral terms is more accurate than grouping only women and exclude people who menstruate but don't identify as female. Using gender-neutral language helps make information accessible for anyone who needs it no matter their gender.

Period Discrimination! Is that a thing?
</h1>
<br>
<p>
  Menstruating is a natural function of the body and about 26% of the global population is of menstruating age. However, periods have a bad reputation across the world for being "dirty" or "shameful." A 2018 poll of 1,500 women and 500 men commissioned by THINX showed that 58% of menstruators felt embarrassed for being on their period, 73% have hidden a pad or tampon on the way to the bathroom, and 70% have asked a friend to check to see if they bled through their clothes. 44% of men have joked or commented on a partner's mood during a menstrual cycle and 51% believed that it was inappropriate to discuss period in a workplace. A spokeswoman for THINX said, "Period-shame is something a lot of women [menstruators] feel, starting with their very first cycle, which can occur as young as eight years old. Those feelings of embarrassment and self-hate are then reinforced by society, which tells women [menstruators] that their bodies should be clean and tidy, and if they aren’t, well that’s not something to be openly and honestly discussed. By anyone."

  How to ensure Period safety? 
</h1>
<br>
<p >
  As surprising at it may be, tampons and other period products are full of artificial fragrances and harmful chemicals. Since our vaginas are highly absorbent, it makes sense to avoid inserting anything with harmful or dangerous ingredients.

Tampons can lead to TSS (toxic shock syndrome), yeast infections, and BV (bacterial vaginosis). Yikes! Using an alternative period product like FLEX will remove the risk for a safer, healthier period.

  People who menstruate might not be able to control what situation they have their cycle in or how they experience it. 1 in 5 menstruators suffers from severe menstrual pain. For those in the workplace, these pains are very troublesome. Countries like Zambia and Japan have adopted paid period leave, but people without this adoption, can't do anything. Another issue in the workplace includes a lack of menstrual products. Purchasing tampons/pads should be accessible for the benefit of having healthy and productive employees. Weiss-Wolf, the co-founder of Period Equity, states, "It should be a societal priority. We all do better when we all do better." Aside from work, period affects people in prisons as well. In prisons, there is little access to hygienic products and sanitary places for people going through their menstrual cycles. California inmate Halle states in the 2016 ACLU report, "Reproductive Health Behind Bars in California" that "Pads are not dispensed as they are supposed to be. We are forced to reuse them, we are forced to beg for what we need, and if an officer is in a bad mood they are allowed to take what we have and say we are hoarding." Period products shouldn't be a privilege or luxury item. They are a necessity for basic health and hygiene for menstruators in any situation.
